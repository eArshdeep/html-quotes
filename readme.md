# Quotes

A simple and pure HTML / CSS / JS application that loads and displays quotes from the [lukePeavey / quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) API.

A user can click to load more or clear all quotes. Local browser storage is used to cache loaded quotes during browser reloads or revisits to avoid frivolous API calls.
